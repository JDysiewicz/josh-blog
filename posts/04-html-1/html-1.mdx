# HTML (~ 10 min)
HTML and CSS, along with JS, make up the Triforce of the web. Almost every website you go to will use these three languages:

- HTML: bare bones structure.
- CSS: styling
- JS: interactivity
  
## HTML Introduction

When I said *Javascript is the language of the web*, well that's a lie. JS is certainly the **programming** language of the web, bu the crown for *web language* must be given to HTML. **H**yper-**T**ext **M**arkup **L**anguage (HTML) is what gives a website its structure.

(Quick side note - technically HTML is *not* a programming language as it lacks the required conditional/looping logic to make a language *Turing-Complete*.) 

### Syntax

HTML uses the **chevron** symbols `< >` (also called *angular brackets*) to denote **tags**. These *tags* are interpreted by a web browser to have a specific meaning when parsed as HTML. For instance, how does a browser know that the following text should be displayed as a heading?

```html
<h1> Hello World! </h1>
```
If you guessed "because of the h1 tag" you'd be right. Notice how tags must also be **closed** off. This is done by writing the same tag again, but prefixing with a `/` character. In short, the browser sees `<h1>` and thinks "alright, everything after this point will be a heading so I'm gonna apply specific stylings to it, like making it larger and bolder". It then keeps reading until it sees the *closing tag* `</h1>` which lets the browser know that everything after this point is no longer a heading, and to treat it as such.

For instance, what would the browser output upon reading the following piece of HTML?

```html
<h1> Hello <h1>, my name is josh </h1>
```
Well, the browser would probably freak out. This is because the angle brackets are *special* in HTML - they will always tell the browser that an HTML tag is incoming. So, if we need to write angle brackets as text instead of HTML we need to use the *escape character* `\`. This tells the html parser "hey you're about to see some angle brackets, just treat them as normal text".

```html
<h1> Hello \<h1\>, my name is josh </h1>
```

> **Hello \<h1\>, my name is josh**

What if we need to use `\`? Well we escape the escape character
```html
<h1> Here is a backslash, \\ </h1>
```
> **Here is a backslash, \\**

## Structure of a website

So, how does the browser know where to look for html to parse and display? Well browsers will automatically look for a file called **index.html**, and will parse that to display it. This is why many files are called **index.html** or **index.css** or **index.js** - because browsers will often look for these file automatically upon page load, and now this has become convention. The following would be a "hello world" in HTML:

```html
<html>
    <head>
        <title> My First HTML </title>    
    </head>

    <body>
       <h1> Hello, world! </h1>
    </body>
</html>
```
Notice how HTML files take on a *sidewards-triangle* shape due to the nature of indenting? This is a natural consequence of what we said before: the browser will parse everything between an opening and closing tag as belonging to the opening tag. That was a little wordy, so let's break it down.

```html
<html>
...
</html>
```
This lets the browser know "hey, everything between these tags (the ...) is HTML, so treat it as such!". The `<head>` tag is used to provide **metadata** to the HTML file. For example, the `<title>` tag in here will change what is displayed on the browser tab that you've got the website open, similar to how, when you go to [google](https://www.google.com) , at the top of your browser it will say "Google" in the tab google opened in.

The majority of what we're interested in falls within the `<body>` tag. As suggested, this is the real meat of the html file, and is where we tell the browser what to actually display when a user goes to ourHtmlWebsite.com (not a real link). As we are beginning the `<body>` of the HTML document, we must tell the browser "alright I'm done filling in metadata, here's what I want you to show", so we have to **close** out `<head>` tag with `</head>` and then open our `<body>`.

## Common tags

There are many useful tags in HTML, however a handful will crop up wherever you look.

- `<div>` - A div (**divider**) tag is how we group related pieces of html together. They are extremely useful for **styling purposes** and the enhance **readability**. For instance we could group pieces of our html together as the following (the `<!-- ...  -->` syntax is how we **comment** html)
  
```html
<div>
    <!-- This is all title related stuff -->
    <h1> Hello, world! </h1>
    <h2> How's your day going </h2>
</div>

<div>
    <!-- This is all non-title related stuff -->
    <p> This is not related to the title section, and so I want to show everyone that I'm done writing headings </p>
</div>
```
The true power of `<div>` tags is hard to see until we get to **classes, styling and id's** which will come soon.

- `<h1>, <h2>, <h3>...` - As seen before, these are various heading tags, with the higher number indicating a lower level of heading (h1 > h2 > h3...).
- `<p>` - Paragraph tags indicate large chunks of text to all be considered a paragraph - a paragraph tag will insert a line-break above and below the tag automatically to seperate out text into paragraphs.
- `<button>` - Creates a clickable button.
- `<script>` - Allow us to add javascript code.
- `<link>` - Allow us to import other files (e.g CSS files).
- `<a>` - Anchor tag; allows us to put links to other websites in out HTML document that users can click on (Anchor is a confusing name but oh well...)
- `<form>` - Indicates an HTML form is about to be presented. These deserve more information than will be given here, and so we shall leave these aside for now.

### HTML attributes, classes, and id's
We gain an additional handle with which to tune HTML tags through the addition of **attributes**. These are placed **inside** the opening tag, **before** the closing chevron. For instance:

```html
<h1 class="heading"> Hello world! </h1>
```

The `class=` is an attribute that will be associated with that particular `<h1>` tag. Using CSS or JS, as we will see later, we can select all HTML tags with a particular class and apply some styling/logic to them.

```html
<h1 class="heading"> I will be green! </h1>
<h1 class="not-heading"> I will be red </h1>
<style>
    .heading {
        text-color: "green"
    }

    .not-heading {
        text-color: "red"
    }
</style>
```

The `<style>` tag lets the browser know that everything in this tag is **CSS**, not HTML, and to treat it as such. CSS will have it's own section later, so let's not dwell on this for now expect to say that the `.SOMETHING` syntax is saying "select every html tag which has a class of "SOMETHING", and apply the following styling to it. We can add multiple classes by adding a *space* when defining its class:
```html
<p class="important paragraph-1 test"> Something </p>
```
This `<p>` tag will have a **class** of *"important"* **and** *paragraph-1* **and** *test*, therefore any CSS or JS that specifies to "important" **AND/OR** "paragraph-1" **AND/OR** "test" will be applied to this tag.

Another useful attribute is the `id=` attribute, e.g - 
```html
<p id="paragraph-1">This is my first paragraph</p>
```
ID's are similar to classes; they can be used as handles for JS and CSS to grab on to and apply some particular styling/logic to them. The difference between this and a class is a tag can only have **one** id, and this must be **unique** throughout the HTML document. However, you can have a class (or many classes) **and** an id on the same tag.
```html
<h1 id="main-heading" class="heading"> Hello, World! </h1>
```

is valid, however

```html
<h1 id="main-heading" class="heading"> Hello, World! </h1>
<p id="main-heading> Oopsie! </p>
```
is not, as the `id="main-heading"` is used twice.

Classes and id's are what make `<div>` tags so incredibly useful. Say we want to have some paragraphs in our text appear as blue, and others to appear as green: we could just add a class to a `div` which encases the paragraphs of interest, instead of going through and manually adding styling to each paragraph:

```html
<div class="blue-please">
    <p> ... </p>
    <p> ... </p>
    <p> ... </p>
</div>

<div class="green-please">
    <p> ... </p>
    <p> ... </p>
    <p> ... </p>
</div>

<style>
    .green-please{
        text-color: "green"
    }

    .blue-please{
        text-color: "blue"
    }
</style>
```
More on this when we cover CSS though!

### Global Attributes vs Tag-Specific Attributes
`class=` and `id=` are *global* html attributes - they can be applied to **any** html tag. There are some attributes which are specific to a particular html tag, for instance the `action=` attribute is specific to a `<form>` tag:

```html
<form action="www.url.com/api">
</form>
```
How do we submit a form? With a `<button>` attribute called `type=`

```html
<form action="www.url.com/api">
    <button type="submit">Submit!!!!</button>
</form>
```
This let's the browser know that, upon clicking that button, I want to submit the form by sending a **request** to "www.url.com/api". Well is that a POST request? a GET request? a PUT request? There's an attribute for that! (More on *network requests* later)

```html
<form method="POST" action="www.url.com/api">
    <button type="submit">Submit!!!!</button>
</form>
```

Well now we're three steps short of a completed form, so why not complete it! The `<input>` tag allows for a text-box the use can type in to (Notice, `<input>` is a **self-closing** tag - we don't need to add `</input>` at the end, just a `/>` instead of the usual `>`, this is because the user will fill in the input field, so we don't need to write anything inside it):

```html
<form method="POST" action="www.url.com/api">
    <input />
    <button type="submit">Submit!!!!</button>
</form>
```
But how does the browser know what kind of information will be input? With the `type=` attribute again:

```html
<form method="POST" action="www.url.com/api">
    <input type="password" />
    <button type="submit">Submit!!!!</button>
</form>
```
Note, "password", is a *specific* type name that will be recognised by the browser, as is "email" and "text", which will apply some specific styling/internal working to it. For example, adding `type="password"` to an input field will blank out what the user writes into it.

```html
<form method="POST" action="www.url.com/api">
    <input type="email" />
    <input type="password" />
    <button type="submit">Submit!!!!</button>
</form>
```

So now we have a field where someone can input a password and email, and send it to "www.url.com/api" upon submission. But how does the browser know what data is the email, and which is the password? Yup you guessed it, another attribute, called `name=`:

```html
<form method="POST" action="www.url.com/api">
    <input name="userEmail" type="email" />
    <input name="userPassword" type="password" />
    <button type="submit">Submit!!!!</button>
</form>
```

**Done**. That is a perfectly valid HTML form in which one can input an email and a password, send it to another website via a POST request, and will effectively send the data in the "email" field as a variable called "user-email", and that of password as "user-password". Imagine this as an object "sent" to "www.url.com/api".

```javascript
let requestObjectSent = {
    userEmail: "myemail@gmail.com",
    userPassword: "SuperSecretPassword"
};
```

As can be seen, attributes are a very powerful way of adding additional functionality and nuance to an HTML document.

## Including JS and CSS
We can incorporate CSS and JS into our HTML file by use of the `<link>` and `<script>` tags, respectively. 

```html
<link href="path/to/file.css" /> 
<link href="www.css-files.com/index.css" />

<script src="path/to/file.js"></script>
<script>
    console.log("Hi");
</script>
```

We import a CSS file through the `href=` attribute on a `<link>` tag, and can specify a file on our computer by putting the relative path to it, or to some website which is hosting a .css file to be downloaded. We can also directly write css into our document using the `style` tag.

 JS files are imported similarly by using the `<script>` tag. The `src=` attribute can be used to specify a source of the JS file (either locally or on a website), or we can directly write JS into out HTML document in the enclosing `<script>` tag. It is usually good practice to **avoid** writing css or JS directly into an HTML document when possible, as to keep things separated and modularized.
